			<p>Hello there! My name is Jimmy Alford, I am currently studying to earn my Bachelor's in Computer Science along with a minor in Mathematics from Liberty University, and I will be graduating in the Spring of 2018.</p>

			<p>I've been coding for about 3 years now and have helped cultivate my abilities through internships, as a student, and through personal projects. Most of my experience has been through internships where I have worked as a website designer using HTML and CSS, a video game programmer, and, last summer, I interned at Princeton University where I worked with Internet of Things (IoT) devices to track air quality around campus. At Princeton, I got to learn how to parse JSON, what API is and how it's useful, and how to work with an IoT device. I'm especially proud of this internship because my code was used by another research group we were working closely with where they tracked air quality in Singapore. It was amazing to know that what I was doing was already making an impact with people across the world.</p>			

			<p>There are some personal projects that I am working on. For example, I created a garage door switch using a Particle IoT device and Twilio's Programmable SMS. I was able to open and close my garage door by sending a text message containing an arbitrary string to a Twilio number that activated a PHP script. This script then set off the Particle device that opened up the garage door. Even this very website has been created by me and it's helped me get a little bit more familiar with JavaScript. In the future, I plan on working with classmates to make an app. This app will be a simple bingo game and, will help develop my knowledge of how an app is made along with how to have a multiplayer interface.</p>

			<p>Along with developing my knowledge of Computer Science, I am currently working for my university as an RA. Through this job, I have developed strong leadership and communication skills since I am in charge of over 60 students and a leadership team. Through painting up at football games, playing intramurals together, or participating in a giant food fight, our leadership team not only makes the students on the hall feel welcomed, but also feel like they have good friends that they can connect to when they are on the hall.</p>

			<p>Besides coding, I also have a passion for running. Even though I see myself as a programmer, I would love to run professionally. Unfortunately, I never got the genes to be able to pursue that dream. In my free time, you can either find me playing video games, reading, or hanging out with my girlfriend.</p>

			<p>Enjoy the site!</p>
